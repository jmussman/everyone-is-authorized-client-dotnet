# Everyone is Authorized Client (.NET)

This project contains a class representing a client-side service component that authorizes a purchase 100%
of the time, as long as the credit card number is valid.
The purpose is to use this authorizer to demonstrate how to reduce tight-coupling by using dependency injection.
This project provides a non-deterministic result for making a purchase, which cannot be used in a unit or
integration test.

When paired with the Bankd of Random Credit project (https://github.com/jmussman/the-bank-of-random-credit-authorizer-dotnet)
it provides the foundation to introduce the Adapter
pattern and add a runtime reason for using dependency injection.
