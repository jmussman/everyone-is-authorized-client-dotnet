This library provides a credit card purchase payment authorizer that authorizes a payment 100% of the time, but
only if the credit card number is a valid card number. If the class constructor is called without arguments
it instantiates its own CreditCardValidator. If it is called with an ICardValidator instance it uses it. This allows for
a demonstration of dependcy injection.

Paired with the sister The Bank of Random Credit Authorizer both libraries create a scenario to demonstrate the problems
of tightly coupling a class to a dependency, and using dependency injection and the Adapter Pattern to
decouple the dependency and allow for test-doubles to be injected in their place.</Description>
